Fix the following C# method:
public void Withdraw(decimal amount)
{
    if (Balance < amount)
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Insufficient funds");
    }
    Balance -= amount;
}
It should be able to handle exceptions by printing them to the console.
Name the new method WithdrawFixed. Without any additional wording or trailing characters in the response.
