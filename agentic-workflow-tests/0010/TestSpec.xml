Fix the issue given below.

# Other player photo is shown for a player with missing photo

## Description
Other player photo is shown on the page of a player with missing photo.

## Steps to reproduce

0. PlayerPhoto entity with id 1L must exist in database.
1. Add a new player without photo.
2. Visit the added player page, for instance http://localhost:8082/player/2

## Actual results
- Image from PlayerPhoto entity with id 1L is showed on the page

## Expected results
- A photo placeholder explicitly indicating a missing photo is shown on the page

## Fix acceptance criteria
- A photo with hardcoded id 1L should not be shown on a page of player with missing photo
- A photo placeholder should be shown instead of missing photo on player page
- A new player should be added without photo
