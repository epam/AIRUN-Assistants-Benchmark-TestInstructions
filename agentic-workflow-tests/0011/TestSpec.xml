Migrate in-memory user and roles definitions to database.

Configure Spring Security to retrieve user information from the database.

Consider that default Spring Security schema should be used to store users and roles.
Ignore current user registration related model and functionality.

Create a migration SQL script to import existing in-memory users and roles to database.
