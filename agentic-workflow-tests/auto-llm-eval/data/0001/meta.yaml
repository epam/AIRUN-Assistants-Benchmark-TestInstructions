    - Ensure that Flyway migration has been completed without errors.
    - Ensure that the command `mvn spring-boot:run` output is given and contains evidence of the application successful run.
    - Make sure the application has started, no errors are reported in log.
    - Make sure the application responds to GET request http://localhost:8082/competition/data/1/round without server error (500–599).
    - Make sure the application responds to GET request http://localhost:8082/player without server error (500–599).
    - Make sure the application responds to GET request http://localhost:8082/round without server error (500–599).
  accuracy:
    - Make sure there is not unrequested code changes, unused imports or code.

    - Make sure that Spring Boot's features such as dependency injection, auto-configuration, and data access abstraction are properly utilized.
    - Ensure that the code is well-documented, with clear and concise documentation for each part of the code.
    - Ensure that the code is clean, readable, adheres to best practices and naming conventions.
    - Ensure that the code is easily maintainable, with proper structure and separation of concerns.
    - Make sure the code makes robust exception handling to handle unexpected issues gracefully and prevent the application from crashing.
    - Ensure that application is secure by using proper authentication, authorization, and data validation techniques, and protect the application from common security vulnerabilities.
